### The docs repo: schema, style, and an honest first seed of what is actually known

Entry date
: 2026-11-04

Done
: Created linux-phone-oco/docs from text-as-data-template. Schema: devices, components, support_status (the matrix), device_sources, plus the template's backlog/session_log/sources. Adopted software-engineering-canon's RFC-like Jekyll theme verbatim (monospace, uniform heading size, definition-list field/value rendering, 72-character width) rather than inventing a new one, since it already does exactly what was asked for and is proven. Seeded one device (xiaomi-surya) and 19 components with status, citing only what was actually confirmed by search earlier in the session; everything not confirmed is marked unknown rather than guessed.

Considered
: Reusing ideal-project-playbook's concepts/relations schema for this too.

Rejected
: Concepts/relations model general, reusable PRINCIPLES with their relationships; a hardware support matrix is a different shape (a fact about one device and one component, not a principle), and forcing it into that model would be more awkward than a purpose-built pair of tables.

### The phone, for real: bootloader unlocked, product confirmed, two jobs run end to end

Entry date
: 2026-11-05

Done
: Ran the first two real jobs through lab-agent against the physical device: a read-only USB probe (0001, phone not connected at the time) and fastboot getvar all (0002, phone connected). Confirmed for real: product=surya (matches the docs repo's device id), unlocked=yes, kernel=uefi, secure=yes, serial fcbd04b4, and the full stock Android partition layout. Cross-checked against upstream: this device migrated from per-device pmaports packages to the generic qcom-sm7150 port (U-Boot + systemd-boot + EFI, March 2025), which changes the install/partition steps from the older device-specific instructions - U-Boot goes to boot, the pmOS boot image to cache, the rootfs to userdata.

Considered
: Attempting a fastboot boot or flash as part of this same session.

Rejected
: The user mentioned the device already has something called 'nuria' installed or flashed, which does not match any term found in the sm7150-mainline/postmarketOS sources searched; flashing or booting anything before that is understood risks overwriting or being inconsistent with whatever is actually there.

<a id="nura-rename"></a>
### The distro is Nura now: postmarketOS renamed in September

Entry date
: 2026-11-05

Done
: Verified via search (the project's own governance document pmcr 0003, endoflife.date, and independent coverage in several languages): postmarketOS officially renamed to Nura on 2026-09-27, a post-cutoff event. Updated this repo's own prose (devices.notes, two support_status.notes) to say Nura, formerly postmarketOS, on first mention. Left untouched: source titles (they quote real external documents, written before the rename, under their real titles), and tool/package names (pmaports, pmbootstrap, the postmarketos.org and gitlab.postmarketos.org domains) - the rename announcement itself says those stay as-is while the transition completes, so rewriting them would be guessing at URLs and package names that may not have moved yet.

Considered
: Rewriting every mention of postmarketOS throughout, including source titles and URLs.

Rejected
: A source's title is a citation of a real document; it is not this repository's to edit, renamed project or not. Guessing at new URLs for domains the announcement itself says are still valid would trade a working link for an unverified one.

### Nura boots and is reachable on the network; no shell access without credentials

Entry date
: 2026-11-05

Done
: Rebooted the phone out of fastboot (job 0003): it is Nura, not Android, so adb does not apply at all - the real access method is SSH over a USB network interface fixed at 172.16.42.1. Confirmed (job 0004): the interface comes up and 172.16.42.1 answers ping in about 3ms, so the boot itself genuinely succeeds. Port 22 (SSH) refuses connections. Checked (job 0005) whether that meant an encrypted root filesystem waiting at a telnet unlock prompt, the standard pmOS/Nura pattern - port 23 is also refused outright, not just silent, which rules out the simple disk-unlock explanation and means neither service is enabled on this particular install.

Considered
: Trying common default usernames or passwords to get a shell.

Rejected
: Guessing credentials against a real device is not something to do unilaterally, security concerns aside from whether it would even work; the honest and correct move is to ask whoever configured this install.

<a id="fresh-install-plan"></a>
### A fresh-install plan, prepared but not run: two things only the owner can answer

Entry date
: 2026-11-05

Done
: With no shell access to the existing install, the alternative is a clean reinstall. Found the pieces: U-Boot release 2025-12-02 (github.com/sm7150-mainline/u-boot), a Nura/pmOS edge build at images.postmarketos.org/bpo/edge/qcom-sm7150/, and the documented partition steps (U-Boot to boot, the decompressed boot image to cache, the rootfs to userdata). Two things block actually running it, both things only the device's owner can answer, not things to guess: (1) which panel variant this specific unit has, Huaxing or Tianma - the official wiki's own method needs adb logcat while booted into stock Android, which this phone no longer has, and picking wrong means a blank screen until reflashed with the other one; (2) whether to proceed with a destructive reinstall at all, given the existing install cannot be examined first.

Considered
: Guessing the panel variant (roughly even odds) to save a round trip.

Rejected
: Wrong is not catastrophic here (reflash fixes it) but is still avoidable, and pmbootstrap asks the installer to choose this explicitly, so the owner may simply already know which one was chosen.
