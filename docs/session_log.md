### The docs repo: schema, style, and an honest first seed of what is actually known

Entry date
: 2026-11-04

Done
: Created linux-phone-oco/docs from text-as-data-template. Schema: devices, components, support_status (the matrix), device_sources, plus the template's backlog/session_log/sources. Adopted software-engineering-canon's RFC-like Jekyll theme verbatim (monospace, uniform heading size, definition-list field/value rendering, 72-character width) rather than inventing a new one, since it already does exactly what was asked for and is proven. Seeded one device (xiaomi-surya) and 19 components with status, citing only what was actually confirmed by search earlier in the session; everything not confirmed is marked unknown rather than guessed.

Considered
: Reusing ideal-project-playbook's concepts/relations schema for this too.

Rejected
: Concepts/relations model general, reusable PRINCIPLES with their relationships; a hardware support matrix is a different shape (a fact about one device and one component, not a principle), and forcing it into that model would be more awkward than a purpose-built pair of tables.

### The phone, for real: bootloader unlocked, product confirmed, two jobs run end to end

Entry date
: 2026-11-05

Done
: Ran the first two real jobs through lab-agent against the physical device: a read-only USB probe (0001, phone not connected at the time) and fastboot getvar all (0002, phone connected). Confirmed for real: product=surya (matches the docs repo's device id), unlocked=yes, kernel=uefi, secure=yes, serial fcbd04b4, and the full stock Android partition layout. Cross-checked against upstream: this device migrated from per-device pmaports packages to the generic qcom-sm7150 port (U-Boot + systemd-boot + EFI, March 2025), which changes the install/partition steps from the older device-specific instructions - U-Boot goes to boot, the pmOS boot image to cache, the rootfs to userdata.

Considered
: Attempting a fastboot boot or flash as part of this same session.

Rejected
: The user mentioned the device already has something called 'nuria' installed or flashed, which does not match any term found in the sm7150-mainline/postmarketOS sources searched; flashing or booting anything before that is understood risks overwriting or being inconsistent with whatever is actually there.

### The distro is Nura now: postmarketOS renamed in September

Entry date
: 2026-11-05

Done
: Verified via search (the project's own governance document pmcr 0003, endoflife.date, and independent coverage in several languages): postmarketOS officially renamed to Nura on 2026-09-27, a post-cutoff event. Updated this repo's own prose (devices.notes, two support_status.notes) to say Nura, formerly postmarketOS, on first mention. Left untouched: source titles (they quote real external documents, written before the rename, under their real titles), and tool/package names (pmaports, pmbootstrap, the postmarketos.org and gitlab.postmarketos.org domains) - the rename announcement itself says those stay as-is while the transition completes, so rewriting them would be guessing at URLs and package names that may not have moved yet.

Considered
: Rewriting every mention of postmarketOS throughout, including source titles and URLs.

Rejected
: A source's title is a citation of a real document; it is not this repository's to edit, renamed project or not. Guessing at new URLs for domains the announcement itself says are still valid would trade a working link for an unverified one.
