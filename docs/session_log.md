<a id="docs-repo-created"></a>
### The docs repo: schema, style, and an honest first seed of what is actually known

Entry date
: 2026-11-04

Done
: Created linux-phone-oco/docs from text-as-data-template. Schema: devices, components, support_status (the matrix), device_sources, plus the template's backlog/session_log/sources. Adopted software-engineering-canon's RFC-like Jekyll theme verbatim (monospace, uniform heading size, definition-list field/value rendering, 72-character width) rather than inventing a new one, since it already does exactly what was asked for and is proven. Seeded one device (xiaomi-surya) and 19 components with status, citing only what was actually confirmed by search earlier in the session; everything not confirmed is marked unknown rather than guessed.

Considered
: Reusing ideal-project-playbook's concepts/relations schema for this too.

Rejected
: Concepts/relations model general, reusable PRINCIPLES with their relationships; a hardware support matrix is a different shape (a fact about one device and one component, not a principle), and forcing it into that model would be more awkward than a purpose-built pair of tables.

<a id="first-fastboot-probe"></a>
### The phone, for real: bootloader unlocked, product confirmed, two jobs run end to end

Entry date
: 2026-11-05

Done
: Ran the first two real jobs through lab-agent against the physical device: a read-only USB probe (0001, phone not connected at the time) and fastboot getvar all (0002, phone connected). Confirmed for real: product=surya (matches the docs repo's device id), unlocked=yes, kernel=uefi, secure=yes, serial fcbd04b4, and the full stock Android partition layout. Cross-checked against upstream: this device migrated from per-device pmaports packages to the generic qcom-sm7150 port (U-Boot + systemd-boot + EFI, March 2025), which changes the install/partition steps from the older device-specific instructions - U-Boot goes to boot, the pmOS boot image to cache, the rootfs to userdata.

Considered
: Attempting a fastboot boot or flash as part of this same session.

Rejected
: The user mentioned the device already has something called 'nuria' installed or flashed, which does not match any term found in the sm7150-mainline/postmarketOS sources searched; flashing or booting anything before that is understood risks overwriting or being inconsistent with whatever is actually there.

<a id="nura-rename"></a>
### The distro is Nura now: postmarketOS renamed in September

Entry date
: 2026-11-05

Done
: Verified via search (the project's own governance document pmcr 0003, endoflife.date, and independent coverage in several languages): postmarketOS officially renamed to Nura on 2026-09-27, a post-cutoff event. Updated this repo's own prose (devices.notes, two support_status.notes) to say Nura, formerly postmarketOS, on first mention. Left untouched: source titles (they quote real external documents, written before the rename, under their real titles), and tool/package names (pmaports, pmbootstrap, the postmarketos.org and gitlab.postmarketos.org domains) - the rename announcement itself says those stay as-is while the transition completes, so rewriting them would be guessing at URLs and package names that may not have moved yet.

Considered
: Rewriting every mention of postmarketOS throughout, including source titles and URLs.

Rejected
: A source's title is a citation of a real document; it is not this repository's to edit, renamed project or not. Guessing at new URLs for domains the announcement itself says are still valid would trade a working link for an unverified one.

<a id="boot-confirmed-no-shell-yet"></a>
### Nura boots and is reachable on the network; no shell access without credentials

Entry date
: 2026-11-05

Done
: Rebooted the phone out of fastboot (job 0003): it is Nura, not Android, so adb does not apply at all - the real access method is SSH over a USB network interface fixed at 172.16.42.1. Confirmed (job 0004): the interface comes up and 172.16.42.1 answers ping in about 3ms, so the boot itself genuinely succeeds. Port 22 (SSH) refuses connections. Checked (job 0005) whether that meant an encrypted root filesystem waiting at a telnet unlock prompt, the standard pmOS/Nura pattern - port 23 is also refused outright, not just silent, which rules out the simple disk-unlock explanation and means neither service is enabled on this particular install.

Considered
: Trying common default usernames or passwords to get a shell.

Rejected
: Guessing credentials against a real device is not something to do unilaterally, security concerns aside from whether it would even work; the honest and correct move is to ask whoever configured this install.

---


<a id="fresh-install-plan"></a>
### A fresh-install plan, prepared but not run: two things only the owner can answer

Entry date
: 2026-11-05

Done
: With no shell access to the existing install, the alternative is a clean reinstall. Found the pieces: U-Boot release 2025-12-02 (github.com/sm7150-mainline/u-boot), a Nura/pmOS edge build at images.postmarketos.org/bpo/edge/qcom-sm7150/, and the documented partition steps (U-Boot to boot, the decompressed boot image to cache, the rootfs to userdata). Two things block actually running it, both things only the device's owner can answer, not things to guess: (1) which panel variant this specific unit has, Huaxing or Tianma - the official wiki's own method needs adb logcat while booted into stock Android, which this phone no longer has, and picking wrong means a blank screen until reflashed with the other one; (2) whether to proceed with a destructive reinstall at all, given the existing install cannot be examined first.

Considered
: Guessing the panel variant (roughly even odds) to save a round trip.

Rejected
: Wrong is not catastrophic here (reflash fixes it) but is still avoidable, and pmbootstrap asks the installer to choose this explicitly, so the owner may simply already know which one was chosen.

<a id="2026-11-09-boot-hang-and-adsp"></a>
### Boot hang found; ADSP crash loop found; lab-agent hardened

Entry date
: 2026-11-09

Done
: Audited the WCD937x patch on the lab machine (no IRQ collisions, no MMIO overlaps); proved on hardware that aoncc caused the boot hang; got SSH over USB on first boot (a preset beats Nura disable-sshd preset); found the ADSP crash loop and traced it to the sensor registry in hexagonrpcd. lab-agent: agent API, durable results, local-first monitor, GitHub budget fixes, ntfy notifications; surya-lab repo with DT audit and flash tools.

Considered
: Interrupt collisions and missing LPASS votes as the hang cause (refuted or unsupported by the audits).

Rejected
: A Python API for agents (the CLI with stable JSON is the API); a second monitor command (one command chooses local or remote).

---


<a id="2026-11-10-stereo-and-the-picture"></a>
### Stereo speakers, shells, the grand picture, the device lab

Entry date
: 2026-11-10

Done
: Speaker stereo on surya (tas2562 slot-length fix + stereo UCM), verified by ear through PipeWire on Sxmo, Phosh and Plasma. Plasma: a saved mixer state and a tas2562 volume bug silenced the amps; found and recorded. The grand picture: tad-engine draws matrices, a 46-feature catalog against Android, iOS and Linux, the device grid, an automatic test suite whose runs are filed here, weekly feeds (the postmarketOS wiki claims, kernel work on surya), the research sorted into the orgs. The device lab: flash with the fixes built in, provisioning (packages, Wi-Fi), one phone library, an Sxmo device profile.

Considered
: Separate boards per project (labels on tasks chosen: one source of truth); a PR from the feed workflow (the org forbids it: verified data is committed instead); loosening the org policy for one feed.

Rejected
: Guessing statuses for the Linux distributions (left unknown until tests and feeds fill them); PC-side depmod when baking in a module (it made Plasma boot-loop); trusting an image by its folder name (a reference image carried an old test device tree - fingerprints now).

<a id="2026-11-10-conveyor-and-health"></a>
### The conveyor in Rust, health that watches itself, the microphone narrowed

Entry date
: 2026-11-10

Done
: devlab in lab-tools, for any phone from its manifest: reaching the phone, the safe test-kernel try (boot counting, a timeout that falls back to stock, proven live), provision, test, health and watch (a regression against everything that ever passed raises one board task; silent when well). Sound silently lost to Sxmo's loopback card as the default output: fixed by the speaker's UCM priority, and now a check. The tas2562 volume fixed (0 dB had muted the amps). sxmo-deviceprofiles repo. Board: states at a glance, waits that show themselves, mouse selection, real editing in the reply box.

Considered
: Retrying the WCD test kernel with more variations; GitHub auto-merge for releases (a workflow token's merge starts no workflows); the initramfs debug shell for unattended tries.

Rejected
: The clocks as the WCD cause (pinned on: same failure); the reset pin's mux as the cause (fixed: same failure); boot-time dyndbg for module code (it reaches only built-in code); dmesg for crash counts (a ring overwritten within minutes - the journal is complete).

<a id="2026-11-10-its-own-russian"></a>
### The project's own data in Russian

Entry date
: 2026-11-10

Done
: A translations table (ocoeco SPEC section 9) with this project's own feature names and categories, device parts and milestones in Russian, every row marked by machine until a person reviews it; exported through the mark, so the observatory's Russian pages read them.

Considered
: Translated columns inside the source tables.

Rejected
: That: translations never change the source; and nobody else translates this project's data.

---


<a id="2026-11-10-first-devlab-flash"></a>
### The first real devlab flash, and what a clean flash exposed

Entry date
: 2026-11-10

Done
: surya flashed from the pristine stock image by devlab flash (device tree a43d069d0a49adcd, the manifest's fixes baked in) and brought back by devlab provision: 102 GB, Firefox, the Sxmo profile, Wi-Fi, 20 of 20 checks. Two first-boot faults became the tool's job (a clock at the image's build date; a filesystem left at 2 GB on a 104 GB partition) with a new check. Then the health watch caught the audio DSP crashing on every resume - rare before the flash - which makes the old suspend crash reproducible and shows the manifest lacks a change the old system had.

Considered
: Treating the crashes as damage from the flash.

Rejected
: That: the phone's own log showed the idle suspend as the trigger; nothing was changed until the log was read.

<a id="2026-11-10-its-essence"></a>
### Linux Phones tells its essence

Entry date
: 2026-11-10

Done
: Its idea written for anyone - the phone you own and do not control, a conveyor and an honest picture - and its workings: what delivers and proves each step of the paths of Linux Phones and of surya, with why we care. Three first steps of Linux Phones are left with nothing under them: nothing yet measures calls, connectivity or the daily basics on the best current Linux phone.

Considered
: Filling every step with something.

Rejected
: That: a step nothing serves should stand empty and be seen.

---


<a id="2026-11-10-the-ear-withdrawn"></a>
### What the ear heard is withdrawn

Entry date
: 2026-11-10

Done
: The microphone was the author's earphones, worn on his head, moving with him. The claim that a machine heard both speakers is taken out of the idea; the working stays, waiting for a microphone fixed in place.

Considered
: Keeping the claim with a caveat.

Rejected
: That: evidence from an instrument that moves is not evidence.

---


<a id="2026-11-10-idea-in-russian"></a>
### Its idea in Russian

Entry date
: 2026-11-10

Done
: The idea of Linux Phones translated into Russian in this project's own translations, by machine, for a person to correct.

---


<a id="2026-11-11-parts-measured"></a>
### Four of surya's parts no longer unknown

Entry date
: 2026-11-11

Done
: The phone's own checks were widened and its parts follow their evidence: Wi-Fi works (joined, gateway answers); Bluetooth partly (powered, hears devices; pairing untried); sensors and the fingerprint reader broken (nothing exposed - the sensor service is masked because it crashed the audio processor). Calls and messages stay unknown for a plain reason now written down: there is no SIM card in the phone. The cameras' fault is narrowed: the pipeline is there, no image sensor is bound.

Considered
: Calling Bluetooth working because it is powered.

Rejected
: That: a part works when its function was shown, not when its device appears.

---


<a id="2026-11-11-cameras-understood"></a>
### The cameras' fault, understood

Entry date
: 2026-11-11

Done
: Both cameras stay broken, but for a stated reason and with a way in: nothing describes the sensors; the wiring of seven slots is known from the vendor's kernel; the models are not.

Considered
: Naming sensor models from reports.

Rejected
: That: hearsay until a chip answers.

---


<a id="2026-11-11-microphone-nearly"></a>
### The microphone's chain, nearly whole

Entry date
: 2026-11-11

Done
: For the first time the test kernel brought the whole microphone chain up to the codec; one timeout stands between it and a sound card. Measured: the right channel is the bottom speaker.

Considered
: Booting again without reading the bootloader's record.

Rejected
: That: three wrong theories cost three reboots.

---


<a id="2026-11-11-the-codec-comes-up"></a>
### The microphone codec comes up

Entry date
: 2026-11-11

Done
: One SoundWire data pin was muxed to the wrong function by the audio pin driver; corrected against the phone's own Android kernel, the codec initialises and joins the sound card.

Considered
: Clock and power-management theories.

Rejected
: Guessing.

---


<a id="2026-11-11-recording-tries"></a>
### The microphone: the route is set, the stream does not start

Entry date
: 2026-11-11

Done
: In the test kernel the main-microphone route sets cleanly; starting a recording fails as the TX SoundWire bus loses the codec when it is reshaped for the stream. Power management ruled out. Next: the bus and port parameters, against the phone's Android kernel.

Considered
: Keeping the bus awake.

Rejected
: That as the answer.
